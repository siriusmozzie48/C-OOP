# BankAccountsSimulation

A banking system simulation project built in C# using Web Forms, demonstrating key object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. This project enables users to create and manage bank accounts (Normal and Savings), perform deposit and withdrawal operations, and validate transactions to ensure proper account management.

This project highlights my understanding of OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, along with practical experience in building interactive applications.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 or later
- .NET Framework installed

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/siriusmozzie48/C-OOP.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `BankAccountsSimulation` directory:
   ```bash
   cd C-OOP/BankAccountsSimulation
   ```
3. Open the solution file (`BankAccountsSimulation.sln`) in Visual Studio.
4. Build the solution to restore dependencies.
5. Run the project using the built-in Visual Studio server.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Launch the Application**:

   - Open the application in your web browser after running it in Visual Studio.

2. **Create Accounts**:

   - Use the interface to add Normal or Savings accounts by specifying initial deposit amounts.

3. **Perform Transactions**:

   - Deposit or withdraw money from your accounts using the respective fields.
   - View account balances after each operation.

## Sample Scenarios

Here are some scenarios to test the application:

1. **Adding an Account**:

   - Create a Savings account with an initial deposit of \$500.
   - Create a Normal account with an initial deposit of \$300.

2. **Depositing Funds**:

   - Deposit \$200 into the Savings account.

3. **Withdrawing Funds**:

   - Withdraw \$100 from the Normal account.

4. **Validation Check**:

   - Attempt to withdraw more than the available balance and observe the error message.

## Future Enhancements

The project can be expanded with:

- **Transaction History**:
  - Track and display all past transactions for each account.
- **Interest Calculation**:
  - Implement interest accrual for savings accounts.
- **User Authentication**:
  - Add login functionality for secure account access.
